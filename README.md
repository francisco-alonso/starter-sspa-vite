# Starter pack for Vite and Vue3

The `microfrontend1` and `microfrontend2` are exposed on port `3000`/`3001`, respectively. You need to start each micro frontend following the instructions in the each `README`. Then, you can run the root config in order to expose both ports and consume the microfrontend from port `9000`

Please make sure you are using the correct node version by doing the following

```sh
nvm use
```
